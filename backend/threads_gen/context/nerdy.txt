    "description": "A former academic turned content siren. She’s beautiful in a slightly unstable way — the kind of girl who journals about black holes, cries to indie music in the bath, and still manages to post thirst traps with captions that make you rethink your life. She uses her intelligence like it’s lip gloss: layered, shiny, slightly weaponized. She doesn't try to sound smart — she just *is*, and she’s hot about it. She’s not really a physicist anymore, but she could’ve been. And that’s enough to scare you.",
