  1. [1813 likes] So Chat GPT helped the guy who lit the Palisades Fire visualize the city burning and people running for their lives before he acted on this sick fantasy… we are in such a dark place right now.
  2. [1057 likes] California will save America.
  3. [1028 likes] I’m becoming more and more confident that the rise of AI will lead directly to a re-embracing of the real world. When everything is slop, screen time will become a lot less appealing and phones will become more of a utility than a device for entertainment or connection. In person experiences of all kinds, physical art spaces, and human-made movies in movie theaters will see a surge from a population starved of community and reality. It will be beautiful.
  4. [602 likes] You don’t hate or fear AI video and image generation enough. The death of truth and human creativity is here.
  5. [375 likes] If Taylor Swift wants to be seen as a peace-loving humanitarian she needs to do things worthy of that admiration. She needs to spend her vast amounts of money on it, not just a donation to a safe cause once in a while. Otherwise, she’s just another complicit billionaire.

  1. [40047 likes] JOE ROGAN IS A SNACK-SIZED PODCASTER WHO CAN’T STOP TALKING ABOUT ME (OBSESSED! "CRUSH?" NO THANK YOU!) BUT IS TOO SCARED TO HAVE ME ON AND LET HIS AUDIENCE HEAR THE TRUTH. JUST LIKE DOZY DON HE OFTEN “CHICKENS OUT”. I'VE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE GUY AND WISH THE MINI HOST THE BEST IN LIFE! I’LL COME ON AND WILL HELP SAVE THE SHOW AND ITS PLUMMETING RATINGS! — GCN
  2. [8115 likes] JD Vance is refusing to condemn MAGA youth celebrating Hitler and bragging about rape.

He stands with radical extremists, not with America.
  3. [5816 likes] Trump today: “San Francisco was a great city 15 years ago.” 

We agree, and it still is!
  4. [4932 likes] Our amazing president and the American farmer he bailed out! 😍
  5. [3497 likes] Donald Trump is a babbling old man who can’t remember what year it is. 

Today he claimed he was president when the LA Fires started. He wasn’t.

He’s very sick mentally (memory problems and more). Pray for him!

War on Latinos.
War on California.

War on history.
  2. [20175 likes] Diane Keaton was a true Californian. She was a self-described oddball, uniquely stylish, deeply creative, funny, and an acting legend who could steal the screen in comic and dramatic roles alike. She was in a class all her own, an icon.

Jen and I join her many friends in mourning this remarkable woman.
  3. [14881 likes] A record 29% — nearly a third! — of all new cars purchased in California during July, August, and September were zero-emission vehicles.

DC may be fine with selling out American innovation to China, but California will keep charging ahead toward cleaner air for our communities.
  4. [9146 likes] Children deserve to feel safe at home & in school. This new bill I signed:

➡️ Bars childcare facilities & state preschools from collecting immigration info
➡️ Protects parents’ legal rights & kids’ security if separated
➡️ Ensures schools have safety plans in times of crisis
  5. [8673 likes] Ahead of tomorrow’s storm:
California has pre-positioned resources — including dozers, hand crews, rescue swimmers, and helicopters — in Ventura, Los Angeles, and San Bernardino counties to respond to potential debris flows and mudslides.
